FastAPI with PostgreSQL
This is a web application built with the FastAPI framework, designed to serve a RESTful API. It demonstrates a complete setup for a backend project, including database integration with PostgreSQL.

Features
1. RESTful API: Provides clear and structured API endpoints for managing data.

2. Database Integration: Connects to a PostgreSQL database using SQLAlchemy.

3. Type Hinting & Data Validation: Uses Pydantic models for automatic request validation and data serialization.

4. Interactive Documentation: Automatically generates interactive API documentation with Swagger UI and ReDoc.

Prerequisites
1. Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.10+
pip (Python package installer)
A running PostgreSQL database instance

Installation
1. Clone the repository:
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git)
cd your-repository
Create and activate a virtual environment:

Windows:
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

macOS/Linux:
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

Install the required packages:

pip install "fastapi[all]"
pip install sqlalchemy psycopg2-binary

Note: fastapi[all] will install FastAPI, Uvicorn, and all necessary dependencies. psycopg2-binary is required to connect to PostgreSQL.

Running the Project
To start the development server, run the following command from the root of the project directory (where your books.py file is located):

uvicorn books:app --reload

books: The name of your Python file (books.py).

app: The name of the FastAPI application instance inside the file.

--reload: This flag automatically reloads the server on code changes, which is great for development.

Once the server is running, you can access the API at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

Interactive API Documentation
FastAPI automatically generates two types of interactive documentation:

Swagger UI: Access this at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

ReDoc: Access this at http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc

These pages allow you to view, test, and interact with the API endpoints directly from your browser.
